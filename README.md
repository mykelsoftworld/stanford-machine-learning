# Machine Learning (Coursera)
This is my solution to all the programming assignments and quizzes of Machine-Learning (Coursera) taught by Andrew Ng. After completing this course i got a broad idea of Machine learning algorithms. i am happy to have gone through such a well put course that present the concept of machine learning from a first principle.
